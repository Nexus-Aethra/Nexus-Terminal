# Install every dshell-* package into a dsh profile as plain dependencies.
# Required because pnpm's `add` only links the named directory and does
# not recurse into its `dependencies`. dsh treats these as profile layers
# only when their manifest declares `dsh.bundle` (currently only
# dshell-bundle does; the rest are plain runtime deps of that bundle).
#
# Usage: ./scripts/install-into-dsh-profile.sh <profile-name>
# Default profile: web
#
# Prerequisites: dshell workspace must be installed
# (`pnpm install` in this repo) and dsh must be on PATH.
