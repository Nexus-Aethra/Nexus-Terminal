/**
 * What the manifests promise the host, checked against the checkout rather
 * than against memory.
 *
 * dshell's 211 first-party pins and the 45 names they carry were the largest
 * unverified surface in the repo: nothing failed if a name was misspelled, if
 * an override went missing, or if the range stopped matching the checkout in
 * front of it. That is how the 0.1.6 move reached the desktop profile with a
 * hard error in hand — the shape was wrong in a way no test looked at.
 *
 * Four claims live here, all of them about files rather than behavior:
 *
 * - a package's dsh peers and its devDependencies name the same set with the
 *   same ranges (the dev copy is what the local build resolves, so the two
 *   drifting apart is a local-vs-published difference);
 * - every name we declare is owned by the checkout, through the root
 *   `pnpm.overrides` link whose target manifest answers to that name;
 * - every declared range satisfies the version `dsh/` is actually on, so a
 *   half-done host move fails here instead of at boot;
 * - no `@deepseek-ai/*` name is ever a `dependencies` entry. dsh 0.1.6's
 *   desktop validator rejects exactly that for the packages its runtime owns —
 *   and which those are is upstream's business, so the rule we hold is the
 *   stricter, place-independent one.
 *
 * Two more files are pinned to the host: the client bundler's `neverBundle`
 * list must be a subset of dsh's `PLATFORM_MODULES`, and the install recipe
 * must name every package in the workspace.
