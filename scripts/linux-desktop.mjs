/**
 * dshell's delta from upstream's electron-builder config for the Linux desktop
 * build: the icon upstream never sets, and the installer targets dshell ships.
 *
 * **The icon.** Upstream ships no application icon at all — no `icon` field in
 * its config, no asset under `apps/desktop` — so every build before 2026-09-15
 * carried the default Electron atom. It is a directory rather than one file on
 * purpose: electron-builder reads a directory's `NxN.png` names as the sizes
 * themselves and does not re-measure or re-resample them (`collectIconsFromDir`
 * in `app-builder-lib`). Each name becomes a `hicolor/NxN/apps/` entry and the
 * largest also becomes the `.desktop` entry's icon, so a file whose name
 * disagrees with its pixels lands a blurred icon with nothing to report it.
 * `scripts/tests/linux-desktop.spec.ts` checks that agreement.
 *
 * The mark is dshell's own, drawn for this purpose and not taken from upstream:
 * the prompt (chevron and block cursor) is the shell, the spark beside it is the
 * agent. `assets/icons/*.svg` are the sources; see docs/dshell-setup.md for the
 * regeneration command.
 *
 * **The targets.** Upstream builds mac and win only; `AppImage` was its own Linux
 * target and `deb` is added here, so the app can be installed rather than only
 * run from a portable file. fpm refuses to build a `.deb` without `maintainer`
 * and a project URL, and neither upstream's `package.json` nor ours carries
 * either — the maintainer is the checkout's own git identity, since this build
 * never leaves the machine, and the URL goes in through `extraMetadata` because
 * electron-builder's config has no field of its own for `homepage`.
 *
 * Applying the delta lives here rather than in the config file so it can be
 * tested — importing upstream's config means resolving a desktop target, which
 * throws for linux-x64 outside the packaging loader.
