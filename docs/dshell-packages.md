# dshell Plugin Inventory

This document lists every package that dshell introduces. Each entry
states its role, the dsh service it depends on, and the phase in
[`dshell-roadmap.md`](./dshell-roadmap.md) that brings it in.

All packages follow the dsh monorepo conventions laid out in
[`docs/cookbook/adding-a-package.md`](../../dsh/docs/cookbook/
adding-a-package.md): each lives under `packages/<group>/<pkg>/`, has a
`package.json` with `dsh.bundle` (where applicable), exposes a default
Cordis plugin, and ships a `README.md` with the Model Experience section
when it contributes to model-visible state.

## Naming

- Host-side packages: `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` names follow the dsh
  convention. The dshell packages live in the `dshell` group and use
  `@nexus-aethra/dshell-*` to match the existing `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*`
  pattern.

  Pragmatic note: until a dsh contribution slot is open, the dshell
  packages live in this separate workspace and use a different name
  prefix (`dshell-*`) so they are unmistakable as the dshell extension
  set.

- Each package name uses one dash-separated role token after `dshell`:
  `std`, `bundle`, `conversation`, `terminal-bridge`, `mode`, `commands`,
  `workspace`, `ssh`, `buffer`.

## The packages

### `dshell-std`

- Role: **the standard layer**. It owns what every other package would
  otherwise re-implement: the `/api/dshell/*` paths and the wire shapes
  that cross them (`src/contracts.ts`), the shell line's own reading
  (`src/shell-line.ts`: tokenizer plus position classifier, a pure
  function both halves of completion call so neither keeps its own copy
  of the rule), and — as the refactor continues —
  the dsh seam adapters (route definition, session/world addressing,
  capability probing).
- Why it exists: a dsh interface change used to land N times, once per
  package that had grown its own copy of the seam. Measured before the
  split: six `respond()` helpers, five per-package protocol modules and
  six path constants, two independent session/world resolvers, 61
  type-only merge imports with no registry, and two styling systems on
  the browser side. The browser faces even restated host contracts by
  hand because there was nowhere shared to put them — drift there is a
  404 at runtime, not a compile error.
- The rule that keeps it useful: it declares FACTS (paths, shapes,
  adapters) and the pure readings two halves of one feature must agree on
  (the shell line), never feature behaviour — nothing in it talks to a
  service, a filesystem, or the network — and it is the only dshell
  package allowed to care how dsh spells things.
- dsh services depended on: none. This is deliberate — it is the layer
  that absorbs dsh changes, so it must not be spread across the graph.
- Introduced in: the standard-layer refactor (contracts extraction,
  2026-09-12). Feature packages keep their own `protocol.ts` as a
  re-export shim, so the single declaration lives here while existing
  import sites stay unchanged.
- Touches decisions: for the browser bundle, `dshell-std` is always
  inlined (see `tsdown.dshell.preset.ts`) because dsh's client module
  table only serves its own PLATFORM_MODULES plus registered client
  plugins; a `require` of a support package fails the plugin load.

### `dshell-storage`

- Role: **the storage engines.** It owns the medium behind the storage
  contract that `dshell-std` declares (`src/storage.ts`): today one SQLite
  database per harness home holding every session's command history.
- Why it exists: the per-session `.history.json` array had no index — a read
  parsed the whole list into memory, a write rewrote it in full, and staying
  bounded meant dropping the oldest commands at a fixed 200-entry cap, which is
  lossy exactly where a query would want them. A table answers the two shapes
  the feature needs — the newest N of one session, and prefix matching for the
  shell's up-arrow gesture — with a working set bounded by the query's `limit`
  instead of by everything ever stored.
- The engine is Node's built-in `node:sqlite`: no native dependency and no
  install script, and FTS5 is present on both the host runtime and the packaged
  desktop runtime (v24.17.0), which is what a later full-text search over
  history would use.
- The rule that keeps it useful: the contract (record shape, store surface, file
  naming, layout version, failure vocabulary) lives in `dshell-std`; a feature
  package imports only `openHistoryStore` / `closeHistoryStore` and never names
  a file, a pragma or a schema.
- dsh services depended on: none — it is a library, not a plugin, so it has no
  bundle row. It is host-only by construction (`node:sqlite` cannot appear in a
  client bundle), which is the second reason the contract lives separately.
- Introduced in: the shell-history storage work (2026-09-13). Before the store,
  `terminal-bridge` wrote `${logPath}.history.json`; those files are now read
  once per session on first open (idempotent by `(session_id, seq)`) and never
  written again.
- Format: `PRAGMA user_version = 3`; `commands(session_id, seq, command,
  command_norm, exit_code, at)` keyed by `(session_id, seq)` plus
  `commands_session_prefix(session_id, command_norm)`, and
  `command_output(session_id, seq, output, bytes, dropped)` holding each
  command's retained output tail. Layout 1 also had `commands_at(at)` for a
  cross-session time query that was never built and that nothing read; layout 2
  dropped it, and layout 3 added the output table. Older layouts are migrated in
  place, one step at a time; an unknown layout is refused.
- Output retention: the newest 1000 outputs per session, 64 KiB each (the store
  cap equals the splitter's pending bound, so storing it costs no extra memory).
  Eviction loses the text, never the fact that a command ran. The injected
  preview and the in-memory window use a smaller cap (16 KiB, and 2 KiB in the
  block) — the same output, deliberately read at three sizes.
- Trap worth remembering: prefix matching is a **range predicate**
  (`command_norm >= ? AND command_norm < ?`), not `LIKE 'x%'`. SQLite refuses
  the LIKE optimization for a bound parameter, so with a session filter the
  index serves only the session term and every row of that session is tested
  against the pattern — cost that grows with history size, which is the thing
  the store exists to avoid. The range seek alone is still not the whole
  answer: the index is ordered by `command_norm`, so "the newest matches" needs
  a sort of every match (`USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY`). `matchPrefix` scans
  newest-first through the primary key with an early exit, and falls back to the
  range seek for a sparse prefix — Phase 10.7, measured there. Its budget is
  derived rather than fixed (`sqrt(limit * N * b/a)`, `N` from `max(seq)`),
  because a constant is only right at one size; Phase 10.8 has the calibration
  and the honest trade it makes in the mid-density band.

### `dshell-bundle`

- Role: dsh `bundle` package that lists every other dshell package as a
  Cordis patch row. This is the single install point — users add this
  package and dshell comes online.
- dsh services depended on: `dsh-web-app` (or whichever profile is in
  use) — bundle patches land on the active profile.
- Introduced in: Phase 1.
- Touches decisions: none directly; exists to satisfy dsh's bundle
  composition.

### `dshell-conversation`

- Role: the `terminal` target. Two-faced Cordis package:
  - **Host face** registers a `ConversationViewDefinition` for target
    `terminal`. Its `ViewBuilder.create()` returns a builder that
    consumes both `replace` / `apply` from the dsh engine (session
    events) and the PTY byte stream from `dshell-terminal-bridge`.
    Merge happens in the Snapshot per design 4.4.
  - **Browser face** materializes the Snapshot into one xterm.js
    buffer. Session nodes are serialized to ANSI sequences; PTY bytes
    pass through verbatim.
- dsh services depended on: `ctx.uiConversation.events`,
  `ctx.uiConversation.views`, `ctx.uiSession`, browser-side xterm.js.
- Introduced in: Phase 1 (host empty); expanded in Phases 2, 4.
- Touches decisions: 4.1 (per-session ViewBuilder), 4.4 (interleaved
  rendering).

### `dshell-terminal-bridge`

- Role: host-side bridge between the browser and `ctx.terminals`. Owns
  one `main` PTY per session (the user's shell) and, spawned lazily,
  one `agent` PTY (the agent's own shell, Phase 9.11), each with its
  own persisted buffer and block log. Serves the frame protocol on two
  carriers: the ws upgrade route at `/dshell/pty` (where a `bind` frame
  names the stream, `main` or `agent`) and the `ctx.connection.fetch`
  routes `/api/dshell/stream` + `/api/dshell/stream/send`, whose GET
  carries the bind as query parameters. The browser face keeps ws where
  the page can reach it and falls back to the stream everywhere else —
  in particular the desktop shell, which composes `connection` but not
  `webServer`. Implements the wire protocol in `dshell-architecture.md`
  § 4. It also reads what is ON the session's terminal (`foreground.ts`:
  the PTY's foreground process group from `/proc`, plus the alternate
  screen in the byte stream) and broadcasts the resulting `tui` frame —
  the reading that lets the browser hand the whole surface to a
  full-screen program, and the reason those bytes stay out of the block
  log (§ 18).
- dsh services depended on: `ctx.connection` (frame stream + history
  read, the composition-independent path), `ctx.webServer` (the ws fast
  path), `ctx.terminals` (PTY lifecycle), `ctx.agents` (resolve agent by
  sessionId), browser-side `dshell-conversation` (channel for byte
  push).
- Introduced in: Phase 2 (host only); expanded in Phase 3 (browser
  ws), Phase 9.11 (agent shell + agent stream).
- Touches decisions: 4.2 (main shell ownership), 4.3 (secondary pass-
  through), 4.4 (host half of byte stream), 4.10 (two shells per
  session).
- Everything it persists is owner-only (Phase 10.10): the
  `$DSH_HOME/dshell-pty/` directory is `0700` and `<id>.log` plus its
  `.timeline.json` / `.blocks.json` / `.history.json` sidecars are `0600`,
  written through `src/private-file.ts` — which tightens a file an earlier
  build left at `0664` rather than only fixing new ones. The transcript is
  the most sensitive artifact here: the splitter records the input side, so
  it holds every line the user typed.

### `dshell-mode`

- Role: per-session mode state (`shell` / `agent`) and composer Enter
  dispatch. Patches the `inputActions` exposed by
  `ctx.uiSession.provide()` to route Enter according to mode. Handles
  `/agent` and `/shell` prefix parsing. On agent-mode submit, injects
  the truncated PTY context block before the user message. Its view
  also carries the status card (Phase 9.11): a permanent one-line head,
  with plan / AI terminal / subagents / breakpoint / pipe-task / link
  rows whose details open on click.
  In shell mode the composer additionally owns two reading gestures,
  both in this package's browser face: Tab completion
  (`completion.ts`, which reads the position off the line with the
  standard layer's scanner and has `dshell-files`' `complete` resolve it
  in the session's own world)
  and the command hint (`command-hint.ts`) — the tail of a recent
  command ghosted at the caret and taken one word at a time with the
  right arrow, read from the terminal bridge's per-session history.
  The `↑` history list rides the completion list's own state under a
  second source. The hint's ghost is deliberately not a node inside the
  editor: the composer is a Lexical contenteditable, so the tail is a
  span in the composer's floating overlay placed from the caret's rect.
  Each of the three is switchable, and those switches live in the
  `dshell` settings document: the card in the Plugins section edits them
  beside the palette (`settings-card.ts`), `shell-settings.ts` holds the
  client store with a pre-paint cache, and the key interceptor reads it
  through a ref so a flip cannot go stale.
  The view seat is `terminal-view.ts`, which chooses between the
  timeline and a full-screen program's own screen (`tui-surface.ts`):
  the timeline is UNMOUNTED rather than hidden, because it is what pushes
  the grid to the PTY, and `tui-css.ts` puts dsh's composer away for as
  long as the program holds the terminal (`tui.ts` keeps the reader's own
  decision about it) — § 18.
- dsh services depended on: `ctx.uiSession`, `ctx.agents.inject`,
  `dshell-terminal-bridge` (for main PTY id, the agent stream and
  context buffer read), `ctx.sessions` (the status card's session
  titles, running bit and subagent catalog), `dshell-buffer` (its pipe
  rows; optional, reached through a late-binding seat).
- Introduced in: Phase 5 (state and dispatch); expanded in Phase 7
  (injection), Phase 9.11 (status card), Phase 10.12 (Tab completion
  folds capitals), Phase 10.13 (the command hint) and Phase 10.14 (the
  assist switches).
- Touches decisions: 4.5 (mode state and prefix handling), 4.6
  (injection), 4.10 (status surface).

### `dshell-commands`

- Role: registers `/new` on `ctx.commands` (`/compact` is dsh's own
  command and is not re-registered), and three model-facing tools on
  `ctx.tools`: `dshell_get_agent_terminal` (Phase 9.11; it was
  `dshell_get_main_terminal` while the agent shared the user's shell),
  `dshell_terminal_read` (the user's shell: a delta from a cursor, or the latest
  commands), and `dshell_terminal_output` (Phase 10.9 — `(cursor, seq, offset,
  limit)` into one command's stored output, so a long command is read in bounded
  slices instead of injected whole).
- dsh services depended on: `ctx.commands`, `ctx.tools`,
  `dshell-terminal-bridge` (for the agent shell's PTY id returned by
  the tool, the read-only view of the user's shell, and the stored output
  slices).
- Introduced in: Phase 6 (commands); expanded in Phase 8 (tool),
  Phase 9.11 (own shell), Phase 10.9 (output slices).
- Touches decisions: 4.5 (real commands), 4.6 (agent access to a PTY
  id), 4.10 (agent-owned shell).

### `dshell-workspace`

- Role: removes dsh's workspace concept from the running shell
  (design 4.7). Two-faced Cordis package:
  - **Host face** provides a `workspaceRegistry`-keyed stub covering
    the surface `session-controller` consumes, so the stock row
    `workspace` can be disabled without hanging the host boot. Its
    *archive* half is real: `archivedSessionIds` plus
    `archiveSession`/`unarchiveSession`, served from
    `$DSH_HOME/dshell/tags.json`. That is what the stock
    `workspace-controller` row — which this profile ENABLES — turns into
    the remote commands the client's `workspaces` service is written
    against, and so what makes dsh's own archived-session settings page
    show and restore a real set.
  - **Browser face** provides the `uiWorkspace`-keyed stub plus the root
    `workspaces` hook, so the stock row `ui-workspace` can be disabled
    without hanging ui-conversation / ui-sidebar or crashing
    ConversationRoot. The `workspaces` service itself is upstream's now —
    claiming that key was what used to take the whole client down, since
    two providers for one service is a cordis error. The face also
    occupies `sidebar.workspaces` with a flat session list (the active
    list plus a collapsible `待删除` group for sessions whose log removal
    is already committed and runs at the next start), adds the
    new-session dialog (optional name + starting directory, design
    4.7 naming paragraph), and hides the stock hero workspace chip
    with an interim stylesheet until the Phase 4 scaffold takeover
    (design 4.8) removes the whole hero.
- There is no dshell archive UI. The list's 归档 row action is the only
  writer (through upstream's command); restoring lives on the stock
  `已归档会话` settings page. The package's own `/api/dshell/sessions`
  route carries only the delete flow and the scheduled-purge set.
- dsh services depended on: `workspaces` (client, upstream's). It
  *provides* `workspaceRegistry` (host), `uiWorkspace` (client).
- Introduced in: Phase 1.5; dialog in Phase 1.6.
- Touches decisions: 4.7 (workspace removal) and indirectly 4.5 —
  `/new` creates sessions via `sessions.create({ cwd })` with no
  workspace attached.

### `dshell-ssh`

- Role: device sessions. Two-faced Cordis package:
  - **Host face** owns the durable device registry (name, host, port,
    user, remote directory, login method; secrets in separate 0600 files
    under `$DSH_HOME/dshell/ssh/keys/`), the durable session→device
    assignment, and three seams: a wrapped `ctx.shell.resolve`, a
    subprocess route for `glob`/`grep`, and a replacement `ctx.fs`
    provider that resolves a bound session's tree over SSH. It also
    publishes `dshellSshRouting` for packages that need to know which
    device a session runs on.
  - Credential and host-trust posture (Phase 10.10, see `src/runner.ts` and
    `src/host-key.ts`): a device with a stored key connects with **only** that
    key (`IdentitiesOnly=yes` — without it the user's ssh agent is offered
    first and can authenticate as the wrong identity), password devices pin
    `PreferredAuthentications=password` + `PubkeyAuthentication=no` + one prompt
    and hand the secret over through the askpass hook, host keys are trusted
    into `$DSH_HOME/dshell/ssh/known_hosts` rather than the user's personal
    file, and the connection-sharing socket is named by a digest of the
    destination and the device id (short enough for a unix socket path; dropped
    entirely, with the connection made without reuse, where `$DSH_HOME` is too
    deep for one). A successful connection **test** reports the fingerprint it
    trusts — `主机密钥 SHA256:…（首次信任…／已信任）` — read back from that store,
    since `accept-new` otherwise records a first contact silently.
  - **Browser face** provides the device card in the Plugins settings
    section and the `dshellSsh` service the session picker and the
    new-session dialog read.
- dsh services depended on: `ctx.settings`, `ctx.shell`,
  `ctx.subprocess`, `ctx.fs`, `ctx.agents`, `ctx.connection.fetch`.
- Introduced in: Phase 9.6; connection failure handling in Phase 9.7.

### `dshell-buffer`

- Role: the cross-session pipe. Two-faced Cordis package:
  - **Host face** owns links (created only by the user, never by an
    agent), deferred requests with a claim/progress/finish/fail
    lifecycle, scoped revocable grants, and the watchdog that
    settles anything nobody settled. It contributes one model-facing
    tool, `dshell_buffer`, as the single door to all of it, plus one
    system-prompt section stating the protocol. Every granted area is
    named at creation (`as`, or the path's last segment, suffixed to
    stay unique on the grantee's side) and that name is the whole
    contract between the two sessions: the buffer namespace is rooted at
    `/`, one namespace per session, and grant ids never leave the host.
  - **Browser face** provides the pipe panel in the frame-wide
    `shell.overlay` seat and the `dshellBuffer` service the sidebar
    header button toggles. The panel drops any session the host reports
    as `departed` — a session dshell deleted that dsh still lists until
    the next start — from the graph nodes and the endpoint pickers, so a
    deleted session cannot linger as an edge-less node. Cancelling a
    scheduled deletion calls back into the host (`restoreSession`), which
    releases the id from that set: the session is live again and returns
    to the graph.
- dsh services depended on: `ctx.tools`, `ctx.systemPrompt`, `ctx.fs`,
  `ctx.agents`, `ctx.sessionController`, `ctx.sandboxPolicy` (optional),
  `ctx.shell` (cross-world byte transfer), `ctx.connection.fetch`; the
  browser face uses `ctx.slots` and `ctx.sessions`.
- Reads `dshellSshRouting` structurally when present, to probe a
  device-bound target before admitting a delegation; a composition
  without dshell-ssh simply has no device to check.
- Introduced in: Phase 9.8.

### `dshell-files`

- Role: the right sidebar's file navigator, roaming without bound, plus
  the two-pane file transfer beside it. Two-faced Cordis package:
  - **Host face** registers two connection routes. `/api/dshell/files`
    has four actions. `list` resolves the session's agent, then inside
    `withInitiator` resolves `stat` (must be a directory) and `listDir`
    and answers with the canonical absolute path in that session's own
    execution world. `cd` sends the session's main shell into one such
    directory, through the terminal bridge's own input path — the same
    one a keystroke takes, so the command is tracked and rendered like
    any typed command. `complete` answers one line's Tab: the standard
    layer's scanner reads what the line expects at the caret (a command
    name, an argument, a flag, or a redirection's target), the route
    picks the source accordingly — the world's `PATH` plus builtins for a
    command, one directory read in that world for a path, directories
    only after `cd`, and, in a second `refine` pass, the session's own
    shell (`shell-completion.ts`: a `bash -c` probe in that world, whose
    line travels as an argument and never as script text) for the flags
    and subcommands only bash-completion knows — and returns the span,
    the position and the candidates — **matched with ASCII
    capitals folded**, because the comparison is a guess about what the
    reader meant while every path it looks up stays exact, and a
    candidate keeps its real spelling so choosing it (or being the only
    one, which applies it) corrects the line. `resolve` canonicalizes one
    path, which is how the composer learns what a `cd` did; it answers
    only for a directory, so a `cd` that failed cannot move that mirror.
    The route exists because dsh's own
    `workspaceFiles.list` is fenced to the workspace root; `ctx.fs` is
    the same seam, just without that fence, and the sandbox only fences
    writes, so listing is at the same trust level as `read`.
    `/api/dshell/transfer` serves the transfer view: `state` (both roots,
    the device, whether a transfer is possible at all), `list` (one side's
    directory), `copy` (starts a job and answers with it), `job` and
    `cancel`. Its two worlds are the session's own (a device tree over the
    same routing, this machine otherwise) and **this machine**, reached
    through the explicit agentless boundary; reads go through `ctx.fs` as
    each side, and writes go through `ctx.shell` with the payload riding
    stdin as base64 (the filesystem seam has no byte write) for a device
    destination, and through `node:fs` in process for a local one — which
    is what that world already is, the same assumption the local pane's
    root makes by asking `os.homedir()`.
  - **Browser face** registers its own `SidebarRightTabDefinition` for
    the `files` kind at `priority: 'extension'`, shadowing the stock
    body (which resumes if this row is removed) and contributing the
    required guide entry that keeps the pane's default page. The pane
    draws a `..` row, clickable path crumbs, back/forward history and a
    reload button, plus a jump button that moves the session's shell
    into the directory on screen — drawn only when the host reports it
    can (no terminal bridge, no button) — and, for a device session, the
    button that opens the transfer tab. Directory rows and the `..` row
    are drag sources for the same jump, carried by pointer events rather
    than HTML5 drag and drop (a native drag session cannot be observed or
    corrected when the browser refuses the drop), released over the
    terminal view the block view mounts, which is outlined while the
    pointer is over it. Navigation state lives in a declared
    per-session store bucketed by tab id, because the pane unmounts the
    inactive tab's body but the store survives.
  - The transfer tab is the same package's second `SidebarRightTabDefinition`
    (`kind: 'transfer'`, a page type, and deliberately **no guide entry**:
    the pane's default page is the sole guide entry's kind, so a second entry
    would move every session's default page onto the guide). Its body draws
    two trees — this machine on the left, the device on the right — over the
    navigator's own rows and levels, and drags an entry from one to the other
    with the same pointer-event technique; a drop lands in the directory row
    under the pointer, or in the receiving pane's own directory. Copies are
    jobs the view polls, so a long directory copy has a progress line, a
    cancel and a conflict question ("overwrite?") instead of a request that
    hangs; the two tab types share one store instance.
- dsh services depended on: host — `ctx.connection.fetch`,
  `ctx.agents`, `ctx.sessionController`, `ctx.fs`, `ctx.shell` (the
  byte-write seam of the transfer), optionally
  `ctx.dshellTerminalBridge` for the shell jump and `ctx.dshellSshRouting`
  for the device side of a transfer; browser — `ctx.slots`, `ctx.locale`,
  `ctx.sidebarRightTabs`, optionally `ctx.dshellSsh` (is this session a
  device session with a mount?), and the `sidebar.right.pane.tab` standard
  props (`ctx.sessions` for the session id and cwd).
- Introduced in: Phase 9.9.

### `dshell-host-tools`

- Role: the gate that decides which sessions get the machine's own
  capabilities — the browser (an engine process here) and the desktop
  (upstream's computer-use provider drives it). Both are upstream's
  registries with providers behind them; what this package owns is the
  question "does THIS session get them?".
  - It fills `ctx.browserUse` (one provider per composition, so the stock
    Playwright row is off) and mounts one Playwright MCP server per live
    LOCAL agent through `agent.ctx.plugin`. The server is the pinned
    `@playwright/mcp`; the arguments differ from upstream's in the
    engine's output directory — `$DSH_HOME/dshell/browser`, not the
    session's cwd, which is where the stock provider leaves a
    `.playwright-mcp/` directory behind. The Chromium executable comes
    from `src/chromium.ts`'s discovery (Chrome, Chromium, the snap and
    flatpak paths, the macOS bundle) unless the row names one.
  - A device session — the SSH router answers for it by session id, or
    its cwd is under the mount base, which is how a session still
    mid-bind is caught — is mounted nothing, and is given a per-agent
    deny list instead naming the currently registered
    `cua_driver_native__*` tools, re-applied on `tools/change` as the
    catalog finishes discovering. The browser tools cannot be handled
    this way: they are mounted into the agent's own scope, and a scope
    cannot mask its own registrations. The deny list is registered
    through a scope minted with `createScope`, because only a context
    that injects `tools` may restrict, and it is disposed with the agent.
  - Both halves are contained: a browser that cannot start and a deny
    list that cannot be registered are logged and cost the session
    nothing. dsh rejects agent creation when an `agent/created` listener
    rejects, so an uncontained failure here would cost the SESSION.
- dsh services depended on: `ctx.browserUse`, `ctx.tools` (read for the
  catalog, restricted per device agent) and the `agent/created` /
  `tools/change` events. Reads `ctx.dshellSshRouting` structurally when
  present; a composition without dshell-ssh has no device sessions.
- Introduced in: Phase 10.44.

## Publishing, and installing from a registry

The desktop shell installs a plugin through its plugin window, which is a plain
`pnpm add <spec> --save-exact` in the reserved desktop profile followed by one
check (`apps/desktop/src/project-manager.ts`):

- the spec must be a registry name (or `name@exact-version`) — `file:`, `://`,
  whitespace and `-`-prefixed specs are rejected, so a packed tarball path can
  never be staged this way;
- after install, `node_modules/<name>/package.json` must declare
  `dsh.bundle.patch`, and that path must exist **inside** the package directory;
- the package name is then appended to `dsh.profile.bundles`, which is what
  makes dsh compose its patch rows.

`dsh plugin --profile <p> add <spec>` runs the same pnpm step and the same
bundle-promotion rule for a non-desktop profile. Both are why
`dshell-bundle` — the only package declaring `dsh.bundle.patch` — is the install
root, and why each manifest now carries:

- no `private` field, and `publishConfig.access: public`;
- `files: ["lib"]` (plus `cordis.patch.yml` for the bundle). The earlier list
  named only `lib/index.js` and `lib/client.js`, so **every host module the
  entry imports** — `route.js`, `stream.js`, `pty.js`, … — was missing from the
  tarball: it installed, then failed at import time;
- first-party dsh packages as **peerDependencies carrying the host range we
  support** — an explicit union, `0.1.5-rc.2 || 0.1.6-alpha.2` today — plus the
  same list in `devDependencies`, which is what the local build resolves; never
  as plain dependencies. A plugin must share the host's single instance of a
  first-party package: a second copy breaks `instanceof` across
  `FsError`/`TerminalError`, gives a second `Service` base class, and splits the
  client module table. A union rather than `^` because a prerelease range is not
  an interval that spans channels: `^0.1.5-rc.2` does **not** satisfy
  `0.1.6-alpha.2` (semver excludes a prerelease whose `major.minor.patch`
  differs), and each channel's own range excludes the other. Floating the range
  is wrong for the original reason too — it lets pnpm satisfy the peers from the
  registry instead of the checkout, silently mixing two dsh builds in one tree.
  The desktop app enforces this shape itself: `apps/desktop/src/profile-packages.ts`
  fails profile preparation when an installed bundle's peer range does not
  `satisfies()` the running host, or when it declares a runtime-owned package as
  a dependency at all;
- `@deepseek-ai/cordis` as a peer (`^4.0.2`), matching how dsh publishes its own
  packages;
- dshell-to-dshell edges as `workspace:^`, which pnpm rewrites to `^0.1.3` on
  pack;
- `@deepseek-ai/schemastery` as a peer for the same reason as the rest of the
  list: despite the vendor-library look, it is one of the 241 runtime-owned
  packages in the desktop build's `desktop-packages.json`, so a plugin that
  calls it a dependency is exactly what the rule above rejects. The range
  `^3.18.2` satisfies the inventory's 3.18.2 either way, so only the block
  moves;
- third-party libraries that are genuinely the plugin's own (`ws`, `node-pty`,
  `@xterm/xterm`, `@xyflow/react`) as dependencies.

Development still runs against the local `dsh/` checkout: the root
`package.json` maps every first-party name to its checkout path under
`pnpm.overrides`, so `pnpm install` links instead of fetching while the
manifests themselves carry what a registry consumer resolves. The same shape is
what the desktop app writes into its own profile (`desktop-packages/*.tgz` +
matching overrides), which is also why a desktop install cannot end up with two
copies of a core package.

### The publishing environment (this deployment)

- The npm CLI here defaults to the **npmmirror** registry: `~/.bashrc` exports
  `npm_config_registry="https://registry.npmmirror.com/"`. That mirror is
  read-only, so every publish must pass `--registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/`
  explicitly (installs may keep using the mirror). Symptom of forgetting: `npm
  whoami` answers "need auth", because the npmjs-scoped token is not sent there.
- The account is `nexus-aethra` and its 2FA is `auth-and-writes`, so a publish
  needs either a one-time code (`--otp=`) or a granular access token with
  "Bypass 2FA" enabled.
- The packages publish under that account's own org scope
  (`@nexus-aethra/dshell-*`). `@deepseek-ai/…` is dsh's own npm org and is not
  publishable by an outside account.
- Publish order is dependency order — `dshell-std` first, `dshell-bundle` last —
  because each package's `workspace:^` edges become `^0.1.3` ranges that must
  already resolve.

### Verifying a published artifact

`scripts/local-registry.mjs` serves packed tarballs over the npm registry
protocol (metadata + tarball endpoints, everything else proxied upstream), and
the check is: pack, install from that registry into a profile whose core
packages are linked to the checkout, then boot it.

```bash
for d in packages/dshell/*/; do (cd "$d" && pnpm pack --pack-destination /tmp/dshell-packs); done
node scripts/local-registry.mjs --port 4873 --dir /tmp/dshell-packs   # another shell
pnpm add @nexus-aethra/dshell-bundle --save-exact \
  --config.registry=http://127.0.0.1:4873
```

A pass looks like: the install succeeds, `dsh.profile.bundles` gains
`@nexus-aethra/dshell-bundle`, the booted profile answers
`/api/dshell/buffer`, `/api/dshell/files` and `/api/dshell/stream` (the stream
one holding the connection open), and the served client bundle
(`/plugins/??<list>&rev=<rev>`) contains the dshell faces.

The desktop application itself can only talk to `https://registry.npmjs.org/`
(`DESKTOP_REGISTRY` is a constant in `apps/desktop/src/project-manager.ts`), so
a private registry is not reachable from its plugin window without an upstream
change; `dsh plugin` plus `--config.registry` is the equivalent path the recipe
uses.

## What is not a dshell package

The following dsh components are reused unchanged. They are listed here
so the inventory is complete; do not introduce wrappers for them.

- `dsh-terminal-bash` — supplies the `shell` backend for
  `ctx.terminals`. Picked up by `dsh-bundle` (dsh's own bundle) already.
- `dsh-tool-terminal` — supplies `terminal_open`, `terminal_send`,
  etc. as model-facing tools. Picked up the same way. Agent's
  secondary-shell operations go through these tools, not through
  dshell.
- `dsh-session-persistence-jsonl` — supplies session log storage.
  dshell never touches this; the session log stays where dsh puts it.
- `dsh-compaction` and `dsh-session-title-*` — used unchanged by
  `/compact` and by session naming. dshell does not override them.
- `dsh-browser-use` — the registry half of browser use: it owns
  `ctx.browserUse` and the tool namespace, and is enabled as its own
  patch row. `dshell-host-tools` fills the slot it guards; the registry
  itself is untouched.
- `dsh-computer-use` — the same registry shape for the desktop. Its
  provider rows are upstream's too: `dsh-experimental-computer-use-cua-driver-native`
  registers its catalog globally and drives this desktop through
  `@trycua/cua-driver`. dshell neither wraps nor replaces it — it takes
  the tools away from device agents with a deny list, which is a client
  of the tools service, not a provider of it.
- `xterm.js` — third-party browser dependency. Imported from
  `dshell-conversation`'s browser face; not a Cordis package.
- `@playwright/mcp` — the MCP server dshell's browser provider drives.
  Pinned (`0.0.80`) and started through the current Node executable; it
  is a program, not a Cordis package.

```

There are no cycles. `dshell-std` has no dependency at all: it is the
  layer that keeps a dsh change from landing once per package.
  `dshell-bundle` is the install root; the others are leaves or
  single-level consumers of the bridge. The optional edges exist only
  when both rows are composed — each side reads the other through a
  structural seat, never an import. `dshell-host-tools` is the one
  consumer of `dshell-ssh` that also depends on it at build time, for
  the mount base a mid-bind session is recognized by.

## Cordis `ctx` keys dshell publishes or subscribes to

### Subscribes to

- `ctx.uiConversation.events` — registers the target `terminal`'s
  NodeDefinitions (in `dshell-conversation`, host face).
- `ctx.uiConversation.views` — registers the `terminal` ViewDefinition
  (in `dshell-conversation`, host face).
- `ctx.connection` — registers the frame stream and the history read
  (in `dshell-terminal-bridge`, host face): `/api/dshell/stream`,
  `/api/dshell/stream/send`, `/api/dshell/pty`.
- `ctx.webServer` — registers the `/dshell/pty` ws upgrade (in
  `dshell-terminal-bridge`, host face; the browser's fast path).
- `ctx.terminals` — `spawn` / `startSend` / `readOutput` /
  `signal` / `kill` / `list` (in `dshell-terminal-bridge`).
- `ctx.agents` — `inject` (in `dshell-mode`) and session id lookup
  (in `dshell-terminal-bridge`).
- `ctx.commands` — registers commands (in `dshell-commands`).
- `ctx.tools` — registers `dshell_get_agent_terminal` and
  `dshell_terminal_read` (in `dshell-commands`).
- `ctx.uiSession` — patches `inputActions` (in `dshell-mode`).
- `ctx.systemPrompt` — registers one section stating the pipe protocol
  (in `dshell-buffer`, host face).
- `ctx.sessionController` — `resolveAgent` for the target and, at
  settlement, for the requester (in `dshell-buffer`, host face).
- `ctx.sandboxPolicy` — resolved against the granter's session to fence a
  granted write; optional (in `dshell-buffer`, host face).
- `ctx.sessions` — peer labels in the pipe panel (in `dshell-buffer`,
  browser face) and the status card's session titles / running bit
  (in `dshell-mode`, browser face).
- `ctx.dshellBuffer` — the pipe snapshot, its load poll, ticket cancel
  and panel toggle, read by the status card's 中断点 / 管道任务 rows (in
  `dshell-mode`, browser face; absent without `dshell-buffer`).
- `ctx.connection.fetch` — registers the `/api/dshell/files` listing
  route and the `/api/dshell/transfer` job route (in `dshell-files`, host
  face).
- `ctx.shell` — resolves and runs one base64-payload command per file
  written into a device world (in `dshell-files`, host face, the
  transfer's byte-write seam).
- `ctx.dshellSshRouting` — the device a session runs on, for the transfer's
  remote side; optional, read structurally (in `dshell-files`, host face).
- `ctx.sidebarRightTabs` — registers the `files` tab definition that
  shadows the stock kind, and the `transfer` page type beside it (in
  `dshell-files`, browser face).
- `ctx.dshellSsh` — whether a session is a device session with a mount,
  which is what the transfer button's presence depends on; optional, read
  structurally (in `dshell-files`, browser face).
- `ctx.dshellTerminalBridge` — `feed` moves a session's shell into a
  directory for the pane's jump button; optional, and its absence is
  what the pane reports as `canCd: false` (in `dshell-files`, host face).
- `ctx.tools` — reads the visible catalog for the `cua_driver_native__*`
  names and restricts them away from each device agent (in
  `dshell-host-tools`, host face). A restriction is registered through a
  `createScope` scope, not through the plugin's own context, since only a
  context that injects `tools` may register one.
- `ctx.browserUse` — the exclusive provider slot, filled by
  `dshell-host-tools`, whose `<provider>.sessions` registration is what
  mounts one Playwright MCP server per live local agent.
- `ctx.dshellSshRouting` — which sessions run on a device, which is what
  decides whether a session gets a browser at all; optional, read
  structurally (in `dshell-host-tools`, host face).

### Publishes

- `ctx.dshellMainPty` — `Map<Agent, TerminalSessionId>`. Read by
  `dshell-mode` and `dshell-commands`. Exposed for inter-plugin
  coordination only; not a service consumed by dsh.
- `ctx.dshellPtyBuffer` — per-session rolling buffer of recent
  `main` PTY output (≤ 100 lines / 4 KiB). Read by `dshell-mode`
  when injecting context.
- `ctx.dshellSshRouting` — dshell-ssh's router, so dshell-buffer can ask
  which device a session runs on and probe it before admitting a
  delegation.
- `ctx.dshellBuffer` (client) — the pipe state and its mutations. Read by
  dshell-workspace's sidebar `管道` entry.

### Replaces (same-key providers over disabled stock rows)

- `workspaceRegistry` (host) — stubbed by `dshell-workspace` so
  `session-controller` resolves after the stock `workspace` row is
  disabled.
- `workspaces` + `uiWorkspace` (client) + the root `workspaces` hook —
  stubbed by `dshell-workspace` so ui-conversation / ui-sidebar
  resolve and ConversationRoot mounts after the stock `ui-workspace`
  row is disabled.
- `ctx.browserUse`'s provider (host) — the stock Playwright MCP row is
  off and `dshell-host-tools` fills the slot instead, because the
  decision this package makes (a device session gets no browser) is not
  one a provider can express from inside upstream's runtime.

No new public `ctx` key is added to dsh itself.
