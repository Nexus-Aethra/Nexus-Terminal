/**
 * The scan: walk every session's durable log, count the token usage each model
 * turn reported, and add it to the index.
 *
 * Where the numbers come from. dsh attaches provider-reported accounting to the
 * `assistant/message` event itself — `data.usage` — and the same event's
 * `data.message.source` names the route that produced it. Usage and route
 * therefore travel together on one event and nothing has to be paired up or
 * inferred, which is what makes a scan over history as reliable as one over a
 * live session.
 *
 * Incremental by session. The index keeps the highest seq counted for each
 * session, and a session whose log has not grown is skipped after a cheap
 * metadata listing rather than a full read. A session that has grown is read
 * whole and filtered down to the events past its cursor, so a rescan costs one
 * decode per touched session and nothing for the rest.
 *
 * Writes are batched, never per event and never per session. A scan accumulates
 * its rows in memory and hands them to the store once, and {@link UsageScanner.schedule}
 * coalesces concurrent callers behind a single flight plus a minimum interval,
 * so a page opened repeatedly still produces at most one transaction per
 * interval rather than one per open.
