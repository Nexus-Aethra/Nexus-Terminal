/**
 * dshell-conversation browser face — Phase 4 (activity marker).
 *
 * The single registration here is an always-active ConversationView
 * Definition on the `terminal` target with no renderer. Its only job is
 * to count the Session as active conversation activity so the framework
 * skips the centered hero layout and engages the docked composer (the
 * terminal-style dock lives in `dshell-mode` and shadows
 * `conversation.composer.bar`). The dock itself is the visible content
 * surface — no separate view tab — keeping PTY output and the input
 * line fused in one column.
 *
 * The plugin also auto-activates `terminal` whenever a new Session
 * becomes current. The stock view-restore path falls back to `chat` when
 * no preference exists, which would put the conversation back in `hero`
 * phase; activating `terminal` first forces `active` phase immediately.
 * A subsequent `selectView('chat')` from the user (the header still
 * shows the chat tab in the view ledger for advanced use) takes
 * precedence via the stock selectView path — we only steer the default.
