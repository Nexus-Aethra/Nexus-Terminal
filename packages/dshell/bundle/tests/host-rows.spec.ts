/**
 * The row ids dshell's bundle patch names, measured against the rows the host
 * actually ships.
 *
 * The patch is the last layer applied, and both of its moves are references
 * into a composition dshell does not own: `disabled: true` on eight stock rows
 * (the workspace group, the chat view, the jobs widget, the HMR row) and ten
 * rows of its own. If upstream renames or drops any of the eight, dshell's
 * layer becomes a no-op — and since 0.1.6 starts best-effort, a no-op is a
 * line in a log rather than a failed boot. This spec makes it a red test
 * instead.
 *
 * The ids come from the checkout in `dsh/`, not from a list written here, so
 * the spec keeps watching the real thing. The composition it reads is the one
 * the `web` profile resolves: `@deepseek-ai/dsh-base`, then
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app`, then dshell's own patch — the order the two
 * bundle patches are applied in, and the reason an id can be introduced by
 * either of them.
 *
 * dsh's patch files carry `!!js` tags, which the YAML default schema rejects;
 * the loader extends it with a scalar handler for that tag. Its values are
 * never read here, only the row ids beside them.
