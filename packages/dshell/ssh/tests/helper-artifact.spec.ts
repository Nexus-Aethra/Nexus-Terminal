/**
 * The device helper artifact: that it is one self-contained file, that the
 * connection manager and the file on disk agree on its identity, and that the
 * one dependency the two ends share is actually shared.
 *
 * Four facts, each of which has already failed once in this work:
 *
 * 1. **Self-containment.** The build enforces it (`onlyImport: []` makes tsdown
 *    fail when anything package-shaped would remain an import, and that gate was
 *    red-light tested: emptying `alwaysBundle` fails the build naming both
 *    offenders). This spec asserts the *artifact* anyway, because the failure it
 *    guards would not appear until a device without a `node_modules` ran it.
 * 2. **Identity agreement.** The digest `localHelperArtifact()` reports is what a
 *    device's helper must echo back in its handshake. The resolver walks to the
 *    package root rather than using a sibling URL, because the host runs either
 *    compiled (`lib/connection.js`) or from source under tsx/vitest
 *    (`src/connection.ts`) and those differ by a directory level — a
 *    sibling-relative path silently points at nothing in one of them, which
 *    would make every device look stale.
 * 3. **One zod.** Both ends are wired through `SshRpcPeer`, whose signature is
 *    written in terms of zod's types. A second copy at a different version does
 *    not degrade gracefully — it fails to compile with "Type instantiation is
 *    excessively deep", naming nothing near the cause. This pins the pair.
 * 4. **No dead intermediates.** `tsc -p` emits JS for every file it checks, so
 *    `lib/helper-entry.js` and `lib/helper/run.js` appear next to the bundle.
 *    They are unreachable once bundled, and `files: ["lib"]` would ship them.
 *
 * Requires `pnpm build` to have run: the artifact is a build output, and this
 * spec refuses to pass vacuously when it is absent.
