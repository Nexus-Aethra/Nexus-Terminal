/**
 * Harness-home resolution — the root the device registry, the mounts and the
 * history purge are all built under.
 *
 * dshell had two private copies of it: `ssh/src/paths.ts` and
 * `workspace/src/purge.ts`. They drifted on the fallback — one used
 * `homedir()`, the other `process.env.HOME ?? '/'` — and neither handled a
 * blank `$DSHELL_HOME`: `??` does not catch an empty string, so the root
 * resolved to `''` and every path built under it became relative to the
 * process's working directory. The purge has now been pointed at this package's
 * {@link harnessHome}, so the rule has one owner and these cases are the ones
 * it must keep answering correctly.
 *
 * Delegating everything to `resolveDshHome(process.env[DSHELL_HOME_ENV])` would
 * not have fixed the blank case either, and case 3 below is the reason nobody
 * shipped it: upstream's unset guard covers only the harness's own `$DSH_HOME`
 * lookup, never the `configured` argument. An explicit `''` is trusted as an
 * override and resolves to the process's cwd. The guard therefore stays in
 * front of the call, and is asserted on its own.
