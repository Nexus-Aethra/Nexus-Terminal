/**
 * The alias root: a session's own directory, when it is not the mount.
 *
 * dsh's file tools resolve a relative path against `session.header.cwd`, and a
 * session that was created first and pointed at a device later has a cwd on THIS
 * machine — the sidebar's terminal sessions are created in the reader's home.
 * Without an alias that path travels to the device unchanged, so `read notes.md`
 * asks the device for `/home/reader/notes.md`, a directory it may really have.
 * With one, the directory the harness picked is read as the stand-in it is and
 * the model never learns the difference.
 *
 * The precedence case is the one that would silently corrupt every mount path:
 * dshell's mount tree lives UNDER the reader's home, so the same path is inside
 * both roots and the more specific one has to win.
