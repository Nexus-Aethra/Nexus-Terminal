/**
 * `ctx.fs`, made device-aware.
 *
 * This provider is loaded INSTEAD of the stock sandbox backend, which is the
 * swap dsh documents for exactly this kind of overlay. It extends that backend
 * (so the local half is the stock implementation verbatim, including the
 * sandbox fence on mutations) and adds one decision per call: which session
 * does this call belong to, and is that session bound to a device?
 *
 * Unbound → `super`, byte-for-byte the behaviour a composition without this
 * package has. Bound → the same operations against the device, over SSH.
 *
 * Dispatch is by the ambient initiator agent, the same signal the shell seam
 * uses, because a call carries no session field: the tool layer resolves paths
 * against its session's cwd and hands the backend only a target.
 *
 * The remote directory a call operates in is derived from the same mapping the
 * session's cwd encodes, so a relative path in a tool argument means the same
 * place to the model, the shell, and the file tools.
