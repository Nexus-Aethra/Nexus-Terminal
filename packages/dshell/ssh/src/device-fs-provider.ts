/**
 * `ctx.deviceFs`, made available to anything outside the policy fence of
 * `ctx.fs`.
 *
 * The transfer and buffer relays need byte-level ops that `ctx.fs`
 * deliberately does not expose (`mkdir` / `remove` / `rename` / `sha256` /
 * `copy`): the seam's contract is "you read / write text through `ctx.fs`",
 * and the relays transfer arbitrary bytes. The seat is published here so a
 * caller does not have to depend on `dshell-ssh`'s internals — the public
 * shape is `DeviceFsOps`, defined in `@nexus-aethra/dshell-std`.
 *
 * The seat is constructed exactly once per composition, alongside the
 * `DshellFileSystem` it complements. Both providers read the same routing
 * table on the same call (ambient initiator), so a transfer that asked for
 * `ctx.fs` and one that asked for `ctx.deviceFs` for the same session reach
 * the same device, by construction.
 *
 * The wrapped ops are NOT a per-call cache: a fresh `RemoteFileSystem` is
 * built every time `forInitiator` is called, because the helper connection
 * may have come up (or gone away) between calls and the constructor asks the
 * router for the live connection. A relay asks once at the top of its
 * function and passes the result down, so this is fine in practice.
