 * the same trust options, the same key or askpass authentication, the same
 * isolated known_hosts — because {@link helperArgv} is built from the same
 * pieces as the per-command argv.
 *
 * The child is spawned with `node:child_process` and **not** through
 * `ctx.subprocess`. That is not a shortcut: the seam that will route a bound
 * session's subprocesses to this connection is `ctx.subprocess.spawn` itself,
 * so creating the connection through that seam would recurse.
