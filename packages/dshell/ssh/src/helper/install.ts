/**
 * Deploy the helper this build ships onto one device, content-addressed by
 * digest.
 *
 * One `ssh` invocation, one shell script. The script does four things:
 *
 *   1. `mkdir -p ~/.dshell/helper`
 *   2. decode the bundle, which the harness ships base64 on stdin, into
 *      `~/.dshell/helper/helper-<hash>.js`
 *   3. `chmod 0700` that path (so another user on the device cannot read or
 *      replace it; the directory is `0700` too, by the same chmod)
 *   4. emit the helper's hash so the harness can compare it with the artifact
 *      it just shipped, catching a transfer that ended up with the wrong
 *      bytes before any session is bound.
 *
 * Why a hash because it is the same check the next connection's `hello` reply
 * carries, and a deployment that does not match is one the client will refuse
 * on first use anyway — better to find out here, where the action is named.
 *
 * Why a script and not a `tar | ssh | tar` pipe: the helper bundle is one
 * file. `base64 -d` is on every POSIX system ssh reaches, and base64 over the
 * stdin that ssh's own `-T` provides is the same channel the route uses for
 * interactive sessions, so no new plumbing is needed.
 *
 * The whole payload is base64 of the bundle, written to stdin. The destination
 * hash and path are interpolated into the script from fields that are not
 * user-supplied at request time (the digest is from the local artifact, the
 * path is derived from `$HOME`), so a shell-injection through them is not a
 * threat model: still, both are formatted as `'…'`-quoted literals to keep the
 * script readable.
