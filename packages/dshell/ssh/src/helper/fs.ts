/**
 * The device's filesystem, as the helper serves it.
 *
 * Every operation here is a request with arguments and a reply with fields,
 * which is the point of the helper: the alternative — a POSIX command assembled
 * on the host and its output parsed back — decides things by reading text. That
 * cost was concrete. Listing a directory needed `find -printf` with a
 * NUL-separated format because a filename may contain any byte but NUL, and
 * `LC_ALL=C` because `stat` and `find` localize their output — `%F` prints
 * "regular file" in whatever language the device is set to — and a failure was
 * classified by matching English error text, so a device with a non-English
 * userland reported every permission problem as an unknown I/O fault.
 *
 * Here a failure is a code derived from an errno, the message is only ever read
 * by a human, and a filename is a JSON string: no separator can be forged, no
 * locale can change what a field means.
 *
 * What this module does NOT own is policy. Whether a write is allowed, whether
 * a version is stale, how line endings are treated, and what a literal edit
 * means are all decided on the host, where the same answers apply to a local
 * session. This is the device's half of the seam and nothing more.
