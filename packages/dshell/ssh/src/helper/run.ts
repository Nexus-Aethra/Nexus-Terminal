/**
 * The device-side helper.
 *
 * This is the process the connection launches on the device — `node
 * --disable-sigusr1 <helper>` — and it is the far end of every structured
 * operation dshell will route there. It exists so that a session's file and
 * process work on a device is a *request with arguments* rather than a shell
 * line someone assembled and something else parsed back.
 *
 * Kept separate from `helper-entry.ts` so the behaviour can be exercised over
 * explicit streams without spawning a process, the same split dsh-ssh uses.
 *
 * Ownership: the helper owns nothing but its own lifetime for now. The lease is
 * a reap mechanism, not a nicety — a helper that outlives its client would be a
 * process with filesystem and process powers and no one left to answer to, so a
 * client that stops sending heartbeats makes the helper exit by itself.
