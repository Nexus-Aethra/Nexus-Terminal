/**
 * The dshell helper's wire contract.
 *
 * dsh ships its own remote helper and dshell reuses its *framing* — `SshRpcPeer`
 * from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-ssh/protocol`: length-prefixed JSON over one ssh
 * channel — without reusing the helper itself. Two findings decide that:
 * their helper refuses any method it does not know, so it cannot be extended;
 * and it imports eight first-party packages plus node-pty's native prebuilt,
 * so installing it means reproducing a dependency tree on the device, where
 * ours is one self-contained file.
 *
 * Operation names mirror theirs wherever the semantics are identical, which
 * keeps the two vocabularies comparable and a later move onto their client
 * cheap. Everything dshell needs beyond that set is namespaced `dshell.*` —
 * which is the entire point of owning the helper.
 *
 * Every reply is validated before it reaches a caller: the device is not a
 * trusted peer, so a reply is input like any other.
