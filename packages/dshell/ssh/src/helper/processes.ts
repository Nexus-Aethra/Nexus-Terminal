/**
 * The device's process table.
 *
 * One entry per process this connection started: the child, its two bounded
 * output windows, and any spill files. Built on `node:child_process` rather
 * than on dsh's local subprocess provider on purpose — that provider's
 * dependency closure is exactly what makes upstream's helper impossible to
 * deploy as one file, and this table needs very little of it.
 *
 * Two decisions worth stating, because the seam lets a provider choose and both
 * choices are observable:
 *
 * - **Children are started detached and terminated as a group.** The seam's
 *   termination verb acts on "the managed range", and a bare `child.kill()`
 *   reaches only the process it names: `bash -c 'thing & wait'` would leave
 *   `thing` running on the device after the caller believed it stopped. A new
 *   process group plus a negative-pid kill is the equivalent of what the ssh
 *   client's disconnection used to achieve.
 * - **Collect mode is the only output mode.** Upstream forwards real sockets so
 *   a caller can stream bytes; that needs a stream channel this transport does
 *   not have yet, so a `'pipe'` or `'inherit'` request is refused loudly rather
 *   than approximated — a silently-emptied stream would look like a process
 *   that printed nothing.
