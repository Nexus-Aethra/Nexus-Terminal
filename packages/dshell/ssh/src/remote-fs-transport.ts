/**
 * The primitives a device filesystem is built from, and how they are reached.
 *
 * `ctx.fs` is a dozen operations with a policy layer over them — version
 * guards, literal-edit rules, line endings, the sandbox fence. Two device lanes
 * can carry that layer: the helper (a request per primitive, structured fields
 * both ways) and the assembled-command path (one `ssh` invocation per
 * primitive, its output parsed back). The layer is written once against this
 * interface, so which lane is in use changes how bytes travel and nothing about
 * what an operation means.
 *
 * The choice is made per call, not per session: a device whose helper is not up
 * keeps working through the assembled lane, and one whose helper appears — the
 * connection is warmed when a session is bound to it — switches lanes from the
 * next call on. Both lanes are always available, because the assembled one is
 * also the tier a device without Node has and nothing else can serve.
 *
 * Paths here are always absolute device paths. Translating a caller's path
 * through the session's mount mapping is the seam class's job, above this
 * interface, so neither lane ever guesses at a relative path.
