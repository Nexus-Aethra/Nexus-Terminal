/**
 * Running one command on a device.
 *
 * Everything goes through the system `ssh` client rather than an embedded SSH
 * implementation: it already owns agent support, host-key policy, config
 * files, and jump hosts, and the harness's own process primitives then keep
 * working unchanged (the local executor spawns `ssh`; its stdin/stdout/stderr
 * plumbing, cancellation and output collection apply to the remote command
 * too, because `ssh` forwards them).
 *
 * Password logins use OpenSSH's askpass hook, since `ssh` deliberately has no
 * password flag: an environment variable names the helper, and the helper
 * reads the password file belonging to that connection.
 *
 * One consequence is deliberate and documented at the call sites: killing the
 * local `ssh` is how a remote command is cancelled, so the remote side sees
 * the session close (sshd then hangs up the command's process group).
