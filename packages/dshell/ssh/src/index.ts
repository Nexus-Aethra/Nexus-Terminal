/**
 * dshell-ssh host face.
 *
 * A session can be assigned to a device; every shell command that session's
 * agent then runs executes on that device instead of this machine. The three
 * pieces are the device registry (name, host, port, user, remote directory and
 * private key), the durable session assignment, and the seam that acts on it
 * (`ctx.shell.resolve`, see router.ts).
 *
 * Scope, stated where it is decided: this routes the harness's *shell*
 * commands. Tools that reach the filesystem directly (read/write/edit) and the
 * ripgrep-backed search tools (glob/grep) still act locally, and so does the
 * visible dshell terminal; each needs its own seam (`ctx.fs`, `ctx.subprocess`,
 * the PTY backend) and is not claimed here.
