/**
 * The translation between a device's remote tree and its local mount
 * directory.
 *
 * A session that runs on a device still has a working directory on THIS
 * machine, because the harness owns that value: it creates the directory when
 * the session is created, and later reads it for instruction files, project
 * discovery and sandbox roots. Handing it a remote path is not an option —
 * those reads happen locally and would fail (or, worse, silently match an
 * unrelated local directory). So the session's directory is a local, empty
 * MOUNT directory that stands in for the device's tree, and the seams that
 * actually execute something translate it back.
 *
 * The mapping is one-way in practice but stored both ways:
 *
 *   mount + '/etc/nginx'   ->  '/etc/nginx'      on the device
 *   any other absolute path -> itself            (the model may address the
 *                                                 device's own absolute paths)
 *
 * `remoteRoot` is the session's directory on the device; `mount` is the local
 * directory standing in for it. Both travel in the session's binding, so a
 * later device rename or a change to the device's own directory cannot make an
 * existing session's mapping drift.
