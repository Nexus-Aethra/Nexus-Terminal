/**
 * dshell-workspace host face — design decision 4.7.
 *
 * Two things live here:
 *
 * 1. The `workspaceRegistry` stand-in. The stock web-app `workspace` row is
 *    disabled, and session-controller's inject would stay pending forever
 *    without a same-key service. The registry is not simulated: `get()`
 *    always misses and `list()` is always empty, which is the honest
 *    projection of a shell that has no workspaces. dshell session creation
 *    never passes a workspaceId (sessions are created by cwd, design 4.7),
 *    so the rejection paths stay cold in normal operation.
 * 2. The session panel's durable state: the archive tag set the sidebar's
 *    collapsed group reads, and the history purge behind its delete action.
 *    dsh's own archive lives on the disabled workspace registry, so dshell
 *    keeps its own tags (see protocol.ts). A purge that could not run yet
 *    (the session was still loaded) is drained here at load, before any
 *    session can be resumed.
