/**
 * Session history purge — the destructive half of the sidebar's session
 * menu ("delete" clears the record, agent half included).
 *
 * dsh has no delete API, and its storage layout is an implementation detail
 * this package must not reimplement: the session directory is keyed by a
 * slug of the session's cwd, which only the persistence backend knows how to
 * derive. So the purge locates the directory by id instead of by name —
 * every shard under `sessions/` is scanned for a child named after the
 * session — and takes the projection cache and the dshell PTY artifacts with
 * it. That keeps the file correct for any backend layout that still stores
 * one directory per session, without duplicating the slug rule.
 *
 * Ids are validated before they ever reach a path join: they arrive from a
 * browser request, and `..` in a session id must not become a directory
 * traversal.
