/**
 * dshell-mode host face — terminal context injection, window-based.
 *
 * The user's visible main shell is the session's shared working context. On
 * every step that carries a genuine user prompt, the *newest few commands with
 * their output* ride into that step as a plugin-sourced context message
 * (`agent/pre-step`, host-only).
 *
 * The block is a window rather than a delta, and that is the point: what a model
 * needs in order to reason about the terminal is its recent state, and "the last
 * three commands" is small enough to send every time (each preview is capped at
 * 2 KiB, tail-first, because a command that printed too much is explained by its
 * end). A long command is therefore never pushed into the context whole: the
 * block carries the session cursor and names the tool that reads any command's
 * output in slices by `(seq, offset, limit)`. A watermark is still kept, but
 * only to report how many commands finished since the previous step.
 *
 * Injection is deliberately conservative:
 *  - only steps carrying a `source.kind === 'user'` message (tool rounds and
 *    synthetic notices never re-trigger it, or a tool loop would re-send the
 *    same window on every round);
 *  - only sessions with a *live* main shell (`history` and `since` never spawn
 *    one), so subagents and never-opened sessions stay context-free;
 *  - a shell that has closed no command at all — one without markers — falls
 *    back to a capped slice of its raw output, and injects nothing when even
 *    that is empty.
 *
 * The message source is `kind: 'plugin'`, which the browser face's session-row
 * extractor filters out — context never renders as a fake user bubble.
