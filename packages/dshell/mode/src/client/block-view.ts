/**
 * The block view: one scrolling column that alternates shell regions with
 * agent task blocks.
 *
 * A shell region is everything the terminal printed between two tasks, drawn
 * by a real terminal (see `block-terminal`) and carrying no chrome of its own:
 * the prompt, the command echoes and their output are exactly what the shell
 * produced. A task is a card — header, a two-line preview folded, every row
 * expanded, and its closing line. Regions and cards sort on one timeline, so
 * the interleaving the reader saw is preserved.
 *
 * The seat mirrors the canvas's view shell: the slot area is absolutely
 * positioned over the content column, so the seat fills it and the inner
 * column owns the scrolling. Without that the column grows to content height
 * and the composer paints over its tail.
