/**
 * What a broken terminal connection looks like.
 *
 * A device session's terminal is an `ssh` process, so "cannot connect" is not
 * an exception anywhere in this program — it is a process that exits after
 * printing a line. Which of two very different situations that is, only the
 * host can tell: a shell that HAD reached a prompt and then lost its link
 * deserves a marker appended to the output the user was reading, while a shell
 * that never came up has nothing to append to and deserves a screen of its
 * own. `ready` (host-reported) is that distinction, and {@link connectionView}
 * is the single place it becomes a presentation.
 *
 * Nothing here talks to the wire: the caller passes the facts plus the two
 * actions, so the rules stay in one readable function.

 *    the host says the shell is gone;
 *  - a bound session that HAD reached a prompt shows only the end-of-output

 *  - a local session never gets the intermediate screen, and its first bind is

 *    failed, and the notice is where the failure and its count stay readable.
