/**
 * Shell-mode path completion for the composer, and the list that shows it.
 *
 * The composer IS dshell's input line: the terminal region in the block view is
 * a read-only mirror (`disableStdin`), so every keystroke the user aims at their
 * shell is typed here and routed to the PTY on Enter. dsh's own completion menu
 * cannot help with that text — it only fires on the `/` and `@` triggers — so
 * `cd /home/wp<Tab>` had nowhere to go and Tab simply moved focus out.
 *
 * This module is the missing half: the state the Tab interceptor in
 * `controls.ts` writes and the floating list above the composer reads, plus the
 * two route calls behind it. Completion itself belongs to the host (`complete`
 * and `resolve` in dshell-files), because the path has to be resolved in the
 * SESSION'S world — this machine for a local session, the device for a bound one
 * — and the browser cannot know which that is.
 *
 * The wire shapes are restated here rather than imported: dshell-files has no
 * `/client` namespace, and importing its root would drag host-only code
 * (`node:os`, the terminal bridge) into this bundle.
