/**
 * The Host-side schema for dshell's entry config.

 * Split from `settings.ts` because schema construction must not reach the
 * browser bundle: the client build resolves only the platform module table, and
 * pulling schemastery in through a shared import breaks the whole client
 * plugin load with a missing-module error.
 *
 * rc.2 reads a plugin's configuration from the schema its entry EXPORTS as
 * `Config`; the entry id in the bundle patch (`dshell-mode`) is the namespace
 * the settings section and the browser's `ctx.configForms` key on. The two
 * documents dshell kept in alpha.2 (terminal preferences, data root) are now
 * sections of this one object, which is why the settings page dispatches one
 * dshell card from it.
