/**
 * The terminal-session identity table: host half.
 *
 * One record per terminal session, keyed by the dsh session id, in a JSON
 * document under the data root. The record is the whole of dshell's durable
 * knowledge about the session — dsh's own header carries the cwd and the title
 * and survives on its own, but nothing in it says "this session is a terminal",
 * and a plugin cannot add a field to it (see `terminal-mode-protocol.ts` for
 * the three doors that are closed).
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing, and each one is a hole this table closes:
 *
 * - The write is a temp file plus `rename`, so a crash mid-write cannot leave a
 *   truncated document. The previous whole-file `writeFile` could, and the read
 *   path answered an unparsable document with an empty one — every terminal
 *   session lost its identity at once, silently. A document that fails to parse
 *   is now kept aside and reported instead of being replaced.
 * - Every mutation runs on one serialized chain, so two toggles in flight cannot
 *   each read the document, change one field, and write the whole thing back.
 * - The table is registered in the data root's move list, so choosing a
 *   different data directory carries it.
 *
 * Reconciliation is what keeps the table from growing forever: it is checked
 * against dsh's own session catalog at start-up, and a record whose session is
 * gone moves to `orphans` rather than being deleted. Orphans are not restored
 * and not shown; they survive exactly one reconciliation, which is the window
 * in which a catalog read that answered too little can be corrected by the next
 * start-up instead of having destroyed the identity.
 *
 * The registry is a service so sibling host packages (the bridge, the context
 * window) can gate on it without importing this package, and a fetch route so
 * the browser half mirrors it the same way the device registry does.
