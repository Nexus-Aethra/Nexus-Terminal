/**
 * The durable dshell section in the user-settings document.
 *
 * Everything dshell configures lives here, because a settings namespace is one
 * document and the Plugins section dispatches ONE card per namespace: the
 * terminal palette the composer draws with, and the switches for the shell
 * helpers that read the composer's line (Tab completion, the ↑ history list,
 * the ghost command hint).
 *
 * What travels is only the vocabulary: the palette id, and three booleans.
 * Nothing here is a fact the Host acts on — the colours stay in the browser
 * (`client/theme.ts`) and each switch gates a gesture in the key interceptor —
 * so the Host stores them and the browser half reads them.
 *
 * Only the vocabulary lives here, with no schema import: the browser half
 * merges it into the client bundle (which has no module table entry for
 * schemastery), while the Host half adds the schema from `settings-schema.ts`.
 * Sharing this file is why it sits beside `index.ts` rather than under
 * `client/`.
