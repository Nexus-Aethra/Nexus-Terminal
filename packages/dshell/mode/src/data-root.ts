/**
 * dshell's own data root: which directory its files live under, and what
 * happens to the files that are already under the old one.
 *
 * dsh derives a home (`DSH_HOME`, else `~/.dsh`) and dshell put two trees under
 * it: `dshell/` (device registry, keys, buffer state, session tags, the mount
 * points device sessions stand in) and `dshell-pty/` (transcripts, timelines,
 * the command-history database). Those files are the reason this module exists:
 * they are the part of dshell a reader may need somewhere else — a bigger disk,
 * an encrypted volume, a directory their own backups already cover.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT the harness's home, and the settings card says so in
 * dsh's own words rather than promising something it cannot: moving dsh's home
 * takes sessions, settings and storage with it, so a reader who wants their
 * shell transcripts on another disk must not have to relocate dsh. The setting
 * therefore resolves into `DSHELL_HOME`, which only dshell's own path helpers
 * read.
 *
 * ### When it takes effect, and the one thing that is not instant
 *
 * The root is fixed for the life of a process: the settings card names it, and
 * the next harness start resolves it, migrates what the previous root was
 * holding, and exports it before any path helper asks. A change made while the
 * harness runs is stored and does nothing until then — the alternative is a
 * live process writing half its files under one root and half under another,
 * which is worse than waiting.
 *
 * The migration is a MOVE, and it is selective on purpose:
 *
 *   - `dshell/ssh` (minus its control sockets), `dshell/buffer`,
 *     `dshell/tags.json` and `dshell-pty` travel, because they are dshell's own
 *     records and mean the same thing in either root.
 *   - `dshell/mnt/**` does NOT travel. Those are the local directories that
 *     stand in for device trees, and each one is the working directory of a
 *     session dsh recorded as an ABSOLUTE path. Moving them would leave every
 *     existing device session pointing at a directory that no longer exists, so
 *     they stay where they are; new sessions mount under the new root.
 *   - `dshell/ssh/ctl/**` does NOT travel: those are Unix sockets belonging to
 *     the process that is running right now, and they are recreated on demand.
 *
 * Nothing is ever deleted from the destination: an entry that is already there
 * is left alone and reported, so a root that already holds dshell data is never
 * merged or clobbered by accident.
