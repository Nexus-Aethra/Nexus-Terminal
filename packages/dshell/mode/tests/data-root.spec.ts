/**
 * dshell's own data root: which directory it resolves to, and what moves when a
 * reader changes their mind.
 *
 * The specs below use a REAL directory tree under `os.tmpdir()` rather than a
 * mocked file system, because what is being pinned down is a claim about files:
 * that a device registry ends up in the new root, that a mount point does not,
 * and that a second start finds nothing left to do. A mocked `rename` would
 * agree with any of those claims.
 *
 * The one thing NOT exercised here is the environment: `applyDataRoot` reads
 * `process.env` and sets it, which is a process-wide effect a spec should not
 * take lightly. The precedence rule it implements is covered through
 * `resolveDataRoot`, which takes the same facts as arguments.
