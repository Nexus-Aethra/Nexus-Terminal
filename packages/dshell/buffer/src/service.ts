/**
 * The buffer service: links, deferred requests, scoped grants, and the
 * watchdog that guarantees a requester is always woken.
 *
 * The shape of this feature is dictated by one dsh constraint: **a turn cannot
 * be suspended and resumed.** So "wait for the other agent" cannot be a blocked
 * tool call. Instead a delegation is a durable ticket plus a message; the
 * requester's turn ends naturally, and when the ticket settles the buffer
 * delivers a new message that reopens the requester's turn — the same
 * completion-delivery policy dsh's own job registry uses.
 *
 * Everything that can leave a requester stranded is closed here:
 *  - an unsettled ticket past its deadline is settled as `timeout` by the
 *    watchdog, and the requester is still woken;
 *  - a worker session that is disposed settles its running tickets as `failed`;
 *  - a cancelled ticket wakes the requester immediately;
 *  - every settlement path releases the ticket's grants, so a grant cannot
 *    outlive the work it was issued for.
 *
 * Grants are enforced by the tool that fronts this service, not by a seam:
 * the tool is the only door, so one check covers every access.
