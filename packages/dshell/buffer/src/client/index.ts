/**
 * dshell-buffer browser face: the pipe panel in the frame-wide overlay seat,
 * and the `dshellBuffer` service other client bundles open it through.
 *
 * The panel enters `shell.overlay` — the additive, click-through frame layer —
 * rather than replacing anything, so a composition that omits this package
 * simply has one fewer floating surface. The entry that opens it lives in
 * dshell-mode's terminal section header and reaches the service by injection,
 * which is the only collaboration path between client bundles.
