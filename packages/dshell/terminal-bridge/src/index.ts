/**
 * dshell-terminal-bridge host face — design 4.2 (main shell ownership),
 * 4.9 (scrollback persistence), and § 5 (the /dshell/pty wire protocol).
 *
 * The bridge owns one `name: 'main'` PTY per dsh session, keyed by the
 * exact Agent (dsh terminals are owner-scoped; the agent calling
 * `terminal_open` with `name: 'main'` mints a second PTY, never this
 * one). A tail loop polls the backend scrollback for new content
 * (content prefix-diff — the stream mutates in place, line-index
 * cursors double-count it), appends deltas to the per-session PtyBuffer
 * (disk-backed, fixed memory window, 4.9), and fans them out to the
 * bound ws clients. Input frames are serialized through `startSend` —
 * one active send at a time, further input queued; Ctrl+C (`\x03`)
 * cancels the active send with SIGINT.
 *
 * The ws upgrade route reuses dsh's own auth
 * (`connection.requestRejection`), so the cookie/token gate matches the
 * rest of the app. Resize frames are accepted and ignored: dsh's PTY
 * backends fix rows/cols at spawn (§ 5).

 * shell in the middle of a command ends in output, not in a prompt, and then
 * this returns nothing and the caller leaves the new shell where it spawned.
 * @param record - the user's main record, when one exists.
