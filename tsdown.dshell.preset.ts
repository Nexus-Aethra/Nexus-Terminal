// banner/intro/footer, and the emitted file name lib/client.js that dsh's
// client bundle server expects.
//
// The config is a plain object: importing tsdown from this repo-root file
// would fail because tsdown is a per-package devDependency, not a root one.

/**
 * Build the bundle config for an artifact that runs on a **device**, not on the
 * host and not in a browser.
 *
 * The deployment contract is one file plus Node: a device has no package
 * manager, no `node_modules`, and no reason to trust that we would not add one.
 * So unlike the client preset — which must leave dsh's platform modules for the
 * browser loader to serve — this one allows *nothing* package-shaped to remain
 * external.
 *
 * Two options make that a build-time guarantee rather than a hope, and the split
 * between them is the point:
 *
 * - `alwaysBundle` forces our runtime dependencies in. Their patterns are
 *   written as `^pkg(/|$)` because a matcher on the bare name misses a subpath
 *   import like `@deepseek-ai/dsh-ssh/protocol`, which then silently stays
 *   external — the exact failure this list exists to prevent.
 * - `onlyImport`, given an empty list, means nothing but node's built-in modules
 *   may remain an import (`platform: 'node'` always allows those). A new
 *   dependency that stays external therefore fails the build here, instead of
 *   producing a file that only works on a machine that happens to have it.
 *
 * `onlyBundle` is set to `false` rather than to the same list: it tracked only
 * part of what got inlined, and an incomplete allowlist is worse than none when
 * the real guarantee comes from `onlyImport`.
 *
 * @param entry - TypeScript entry for the device artifact. Taken as `.ts`
 *   rather than tsc-emitted JS because this side has no JSX and no browser API
 *   to mirror; `tsc -p` still type-checks the same file.
 * @param artifact - output file stem, emitted as `lib/<artifact>.js`.
 * @returns tsdown config for a self-contained ESM bundle.
