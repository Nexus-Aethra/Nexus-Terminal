/**
 * Specs for dshell's PURE logic — the parts that answer a question rather than
 * talk to a service: the shell line's tokenizer and position rule table
 * (`std`), and the parsers and caches the host halves keep next to them.
 *
 * Two deliberate limits, both about keeping the suite independent of the
 * harness: the environment is plain Node (no DOM, no jsdom), and specs import
 * SOURCE — the workspaces link each package's built `lib/`, so without the
 * alias below a spec would silently test a stale artifact instead of the code
 * it is next to. Anything needing a session, a PTY, or a browser is verified
 * against a live harness instead (see docs/dshell-roadmap.md).
 *
 * `scripts/tests` is in scope for the same reason: the packaging helpers there
 * are ordinary functions, and the icon set is a fact about files rather than
 * about the harness.
